# logiops

This is an unofficial driver for Logitech mice and keyboard.

This is currently only compatible with HID++ \>2.0 devices.

## Configuration
[Refer to the wiki for details.](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops/wiki/Configuration)

You may also refer to [logid.example.cfg](./logid.example.cfg) for an example.

Default location for the configuration file is /etc/logid.cfg, but another can be specified using the `-c` flag.

## Dependencies

This project requires a C++14 compiler, `cmake`, `libevdev`, `libudev`, and `libconfig`. For popular distributions, I've included commands below.

**Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S cmake libevdev libconfig pkgconf`

**Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install cmake libevdev-dev libudev-dev libconfig++-dev`

**Fedora:** `sudo dnf install cmake libevdev-devel systemd-devel libconfig-devel gcc-c++`

**Gentoo Linux:** `sudo emerge dev-libs/libconfig dev-libs/libevdev dev-util/cmake virtual/libudev`

**Solus:** `sudo eopkg install libevdev-devel libconfig-devel libgudev-devel`

**openSUSE:** `sudo zypper install cmake libevdev-devel systemd-devel libconfig-devel gcc-c++ libconfig++-devel libudev-devel`

## Initial setup

A critical item is to determine the name your device reports to the computer
which will placed in the [name field](https://github.com/pixlone/logiops/wiki/configuration#name)
of the configuration file.

[Build](#building) `logid` and from the repository root run it (use `Ctrl+C` to stop `logid`).
You should see something like the following:
```
$ sudo ./build/logid
[ERROR] I/O Error while reading /etc/logid.cfg: FileIOException
[INFO] Device MX Anywhere 3 not configured, using default config.
[INFO] Device found: MX Anywhere 3 on /dev/hidraw3:255
^C
```

Next, create a configuration file that contains the name, `MX Anywhere 3`, of the
device determined from executing `logid` above. A starting point is [logid.example.cfg](./logid.example.cfg),
located in the root of the repo. And copy it to `/etc/logid.cfg`, the default configuration location:
```
sudo cp ./logid.example.cfg /etc/logid.cfg
```

Now edit `/etc/logid.cfg` referring to the
[Configuration section of the wiki](https://github.com/pixlone/logiops/wiki/configuration)
for details. At a minimum change the name field to match above.
Such `name: "MX Anywhere 3"`, here is the diff:
```
$ diff -u1 logid.example.cfg /etc/logid.cfg
--- logid.example.cfg   2022-04-26 10:41:59.650418368 -0700
+++ /etc/logid.cfg      2022-04-26 10:47:49.033924388 -0700

     #   https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops/wiki/Configuration#name
-    name: "Wireless Mouse MX Master";
+    name: "MX Anywhere 3";
     smartshift:
```

Next verify that your configuration is used. Run `logid` again
and this time you should **not have** `[ERROR] I/O Error while reading /etc/logid.cfg: FileIOException`.
And instead should it look something like:
```
$ sudo ./build/logid
[INFO] Device found: MX Anywhere 3 on /dev/hidraw3:255
[WARN] /dev/hidraw3:255: SmartShift feature not found, cannot use ToggleSmartShift action.
[WARN] MX Anywhere 3: CID 0xc3 does not exist.
^C
```

The two `[WARN]` lines indicate tweaks maybe needed to your
[configuration file](https://github.com/pixlone/logiops/wiki/configuration).


Now [install](#install) `logid` and use `systemctl` so it runs as a daemon.

## Building

To build this project, run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Install

To install, run `sudo make install` after building. You can set the daemon to start at boot by running `sudo systemctl enable logid` or `sudo systemctl enable --now logid` if you want to enable and start the daemon.
